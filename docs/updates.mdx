cta="Read the release notes"
>
FastMCP 2.13 "Cache Me If You Can" represents a fundamental maturation of the framework. After months of community feedback on authentication and state management, this release delivers the infrastructure FastMCP needs to handle production workloads: persistent storage, response caching, and pragmatic OAuth improvements that reflect real-world deployment challenges.

💾 **Pluggable storage backends** bring persistent state to FastMCP servers. Built on [py-key-value-aio](https://github.com/strawgate/py-key-value), a new library from FastMCP maintainer Bill Easton ([@strawgate](https://github.com/strawgate)), the storage layer provides encrypted disk storage by default, platform-aware token management, and a simple key-value interface for application state. We're excited to bring this elegantly designed library into the FastMCP ecosystem - it's both powerful and remarkably easy to use, including wrappers to add encryption, TTLs, caching, and more to backends ranging from Elasticsearch, Redis, DynamoDB, filesystem, in-memory, and more!

🔐 **OAuth maturity** brings months of production learnings into the framework. The new consent screen prevents confused deputy and authorization bypass attacks discovered in earlier versions, while the OAuth proxy now issues its own tokens with automatic key derivation. RFC 7662 token introspection support enables enterprise auth flows, and path prefix mounting enables OAuth-protected servers to integrate into existing web applications. FastMCP now supports out-of-the-box authentication with [WorkOS](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/workos) and [AuthKit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/authkit), [GitHub](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/github), [Google](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/google), [Azure](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/azure) (Entra ID), [AWS Cognito](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/aws-cognito), [Auth0](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/auth0), [Descope](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/descope), [Scalekit](https://gofastmcp.com/integrations/scalekit), [JWTs](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#jwt-token-verification), and [RFC 7662 token introspection](https://gofastmcp.com/servers/auth/token-verification#token-introspection-protocol).

⚡ **Response Caching Middleware** dramatically improves performance for expensive operations, while **Server lifespans** provide proper initialization and cleanup hooks that run once per server instance instead of per client session.

✨ **Developer experience improvements** include Pydantic input validation, icon support, RFC 6570 query parameters for resource templates, improved Context API methods, and async file/directory resources.

FastMCP 2.12 represents one of our most significant releases to date. After extensive testing and iteration with the community, we're shipping major improvements to authentication, configuration, and MCP feature adoption.

🔐 **OAuth Proxy** bridges the gap for providers that don't support Dynamic Client Registration, enabling authentication with GitHub, Google, WorkOS, and Azure through minimal configuration.

📋 **Declarative JSON Configuration** introduces `fastmcp.json` as the single source of truth for server settings, making MCP servers as portable and shareable as container images.

🧠 **Sampling API Fallback** tackles adoption challenges by letting servers generate completions server-side when clients don't support the feature, encouraging innovation while maintaining compatibility.

FastMCP 2.9 is a major release that, among other things, introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol. 

🤝 *MCP Middleware* brings a flexible middleware system for intercepting and controlling server operations - think authentication, logging, rate limiting, and custom business logic without touching core protocol code. 

✨ *Server-side type conversion* for prompts solves a major developer pain point: while MCP requires string arguments, your functions can now work with native Python types like lists and dictionaries, with automatic conversion handling the complexity.

These features transform FastMCP from a simple protocol implementation into a powerful framework for building sophisticated MCP applications. Combined with the new `File` utility for binary data and improvements to authentication and serialization, this release makes FastMCP significantly more flexible and developer-friendly while maintaining full protocol compliance.

FastMCP 2.8 is here, and it's all about taking control of your tools.

This release is packed with new features for curating the perfect LLM experience:

🛠️ Tool Transformation

The headline feature lets you wrap any tool—from your own code, a third-party library, or an OpenAPI spec—to create an enhanced, LLM-friendly version. You can rename arguments, rewrite descriptions, and hide parameters without touching the original code.

This feature was developed in close partnership with Bill Easton. As Bill brilliantly [put it](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williamseaston_huge-thanks-to-william-easton-for-providing-activity-7338011349525983232-Mw6T?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAd6d0B3uL9zpCsq9eYWKi3HIvb8eN_r_Q), "Tool transformation flips Prompt Engineering on its head: stop writing tool-friendly LLM prompts and start providing LLM-friendly tools."

🏷️ Component Control

Now that you're transforming tools, you need a way to hide the old ones! In FastMCP 2.8 you can programmatically enable/disable any component, and for everyone who's been asking what FastMCP's tags are for—they finally have a purpose! You can now use tags to declaratively filter which components are exposed to your clients.

🚀 Pragmatic by Default

Lastly, to ensure maximum compatibility with the ecosystem, we've made the pragmatic decision to default all OpenAPI routes to Tools, making your entire API immediately accessible to any tool-using agent. When the industry catches up and supports resources, we'll restore the old default -- but no reason you should do extra work before OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google!

FastMCP 2.7 has been released!

Most notably, it introduces the highly requested (and Pythonic) "naked" decorator usage:

```python {3}
mcp = FastMCP()

@mcp.tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b
```

In addition, decorators now return the objects they create, instead of the decorated function. This is an important usability enhancement.

The bulk of the update is focused on improving the FastMCP internals, including a few breaking internal changes to private APIs. A number of functions that have clung on since 1.0 are now deprecated.

In just six weeks since its relaunch, FastMCP has surpassed 10,000 GitHub stars—becoming the fastest-growing OSS project in our orbit. What started as a personal itch has become the backbone of Python-based MCP servers, powering a rapidly expanding ecosystem. While the protocol itself evolves, FastMCP continues to lead with clarity, developer experience, and opinionated tooling. Here’s to what’s next.

FastMCP 2.3 introduces full support for Streamable HTTP, a modern alternative to SSE that simplifies MCP deployments over the web. It’s efficient, reliable, and now the default HTTP transport. Just run your server with transport="http" and connect clients via a standard URL—FastMCP handles the rest. No special setup required. This release makes deploying MCP servers easier and more portable than ever.

Even AI needs a good travel adapter 🔌


FastMCP now supports proxying arbitrary MCP servers, letting you run a local FastMCP instance that transparently forwards requests to any remote or third-party server—regardless of transport. This enables transport bridging (e.g., stdio ⇄ SSE), simplified client configuration, and powerful gateway patterns. Proxies are fully composable with other FastMCP servers, letting you mount or import them just like local servers. Use `FastMCP.from_client()` to wrap any backend in a clean, Pythonic proxy.

Because life's too short for boilerplate.

This is where it all started. FastMCP’s launch post introduced a clean, Pythonic way to build MCP servers without the protocol overhead. Just write functions; FastMCP handles the rest. What began as a weekend project quickly became the foundation of a growing ecosystem.
